# Autonomous RC Car

I initially created this project as my bachelor's and master's thesis project, where that version can be found [here](https://github.com/RedaAlb/old-auto-rc-car).

However, I am re-creating the project from scratch in this repo, with 3D printed parts to improve on it and to continue learning from it.

The original paper of the project when I submitted this project for grading can be found [here](MSc_AI_AutoRCCar_paper.pdf). Although the paper doesn't directly relate to this newly re-created version of the project, it still contains useful information.
